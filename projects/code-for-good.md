# TTP 2022 Winter Final Project: Code for Good

## Purpose

To implement all of the skills we learned in this bootcamp into a single project that has real world impact.

## Task

Working as a group, design and produce an informational website for social cause. This could be a website about food insecurity, deforestation, gender equality in education, prison reform, or any other social cause. The purpose of the site should be to put out (correct, verified, and cited) information and urge people to take action. This could be by sharing the information, donating money, volunteering time, or even just knowing more.

For inspiration, you can look at the following sites:

## Team Specialization and Diversification

Projects like this can be very large and need to move pretty fast. Often, the best solution is to bring together a diverse team of experts with different specializations. We'll be running specialized workshops to make sure each team has the skills it needs.

## Team Responsibilities

*Responsibilities can be shared by more than 1 team member! Each team member can have more than 1 set of responsibilities.*

- *Frontend Developer* - writes react and css to bring mockups to life
- *Project Manager* - uses GitHub issues and note taking to track team's goals, progress, and obstacles
- *Data Manager* - writes react and works with csv/json to provide data visualization components
- *QA Analyst* - uses GitHub issues to track any bugs by constantly testing code as it's being committed
- *UI Designer* - uses Figma to produce mockups for the team to refer to

## Remember Democracy

While each team member has specializations, overall decisions on the project should be made and agreed upon by everyone. Team member should feel free to offer and receive constructive feedback, even if it's outside of their specialization.

## Presentation and Deadline

We will be presenting our final projects to some special guests on the afternoon of Thursday, January 27. This gives us about 5 full days to work. Aside from some specialization workshops and morale booster events, we will be using the time exclusively for this project.
